<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hello World! My name is Valerie and I <EM><STRONG>LOVE</EM></STRONG> being active. For me, physical activity is about more than just my physical health -- it's also mental. I have struggled with an anxiety disorder my whole life, although I did not fully adress it until I was 20 years old. Staying active has also being such a huge proponent of taking care of my mental health. I love both indoor and outdoor sports. My menatl health journey has been a life long one, but I cannot encourage folks with mental health disorders more to stay active! Don't know where to start? Check out some of my ideas below!

    <p>Many summers growing up, my family would go with other family friends to the lake. It was during one of these summers that I leared how to water ski.</p>

    <h3>Kayaking in Missouri</h3>
    <p>As a child, I was not a fan of the water, but now I love it! Kayaking is one of my favorite ways to soak up some sun.</p>

    <h3>Swimming in Missouri</h3>
    <p>Shorly after college graduation, I decided I wanted to train for a triahtlon. Thus began my love for swimming. (Again, pretty ironic as I didn't like the water as child!) Just last week I swam a PB in my 100 m freestyle so I'm basically an olympian now. ;)</p>
